## Welcome to the Data Science Tech Prep Track!

This course is designed especially for graduates of Flatiron’s **Data Science Program**. As you get ready to dive in, take a moment to think back to your very first day at Flatiron School and all that you’ve learned since - it is quite an accomplishment!

In your interactions with your instructors, you’ve likely heard them emphasize the skill of “learning how to learn.” Choosing to pursue a career in tech means you are choosing to be a lifelong learner and keeping your skills sharp is a vital part of leading a successful career.

It’s likely that you’ll join a team that works with different tools and technologies from what you learned at Flatiron. You’ll be able to pick these up quickly using the same persistence, patience, and thoughtful problem solving you relied on each time you encountered a tough lab in the program.

**This track is designed to work alongside the Career Prep Track to help thrive in a new job**. The content is based on feedback from former students as well as employers who have hired Flatiron graduates.

We’ve compiled these resources and specific guidance to help you improve your existing projects and become an even better Data Scientist.
